### Edit
As of December 2021, I think that python fast prototyping (as well as fast and high level node.js standardized ecmascript) fits better most of this kind of mathematical things, so I've just posted a few `.py` (and modern, high quality, manually crafted `.js`, not necessarily transpiled from `.fsx`) scripts lately. 

## Announcement

Learn, use and benefit from this project only if:

- You **condemn Russia and its military aggression against Ukraine**
- You **recognize that Russia is an occupant that unlawfully invaded a sovereign state**
- You **support Ukraine's territorial integrity, including its claims over temporarily occupied territories of Crimea and Donbas**
- You **reject false narratives perpetuated by Russian state propaganda**

Otherwise, leave this project immediately and educate yourself.

Putin, idi nachuj.
